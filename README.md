The user will initialize the program by typing 'node index.js'. The user will then be prompted with questions which can be answered by typing in the terminal. A 'Success!' message will be displayed to the terminal if all information has been entered correctly. A file titled 'index.html' will be created. The user can then open this file in their default browser.

Email links for each team member will open the user's default email program and populate the TO field of the email with the address. Engineer GitHub usernames will link directly to their GitHub profile.
